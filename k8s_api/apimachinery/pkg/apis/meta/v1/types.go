// Package v1 contains API types that are common to all versions.
//
// The package contains two categories of types:
// - external (serialized) types that lack their own version (e.g TypeMeta)
// - internal (never-serialized) types that are needed by several different
//   api groups, and so live here, to avoid duplication and/or import loops
//   (e.g. LabelSelector).
// In the future, we will probably move these categories of objects into
// separate packages.
package v1

// TypeMeta describes an individual object in an API response or request
// with strings representing the type of the object and its API schema version.
// Structures that are versioned or persisted should inline TypeMeta.
type TypeMeta struct {
	// Kind is a string value representing the REST resource this object represents.
	// Servers may infer this from the endpoint the client submits requests to.
	// Cannot be updated.
	// In CamelCase.
	// More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#types-kinds
	Kind string `json:"kind,omitempty"`

	// APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
	// Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
	// may reject unrecognized values.
	// More info: https://git.k8s.io/community/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md#resources
	APIVersion string `json:"apiVersion,omitempty"`
}

// ObjectMeta is metadata that all persisted resources must have, which includes all objects
// users must create.
type ObjectMeta struct {
	// Name must be unique within a namespace. Is required when creating resources, although
	// some resources may allow a client to request the generation of an appropriate name
	// automatically. Name is primarily intended for creation idempotence and configuration
	// definition.
	// Cannot be updated.
	// More info: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/identifiers#names
	Name string `json:"name,omitempty"`

	// Map of string keys and values that can be used to organize and categorize
	// (scope and select) objects. May match selectors of replication controllers
	// and services.
